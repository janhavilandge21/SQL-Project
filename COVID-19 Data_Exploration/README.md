# "COVID 19 DATA EXPLORATION"
This SQL project aims to explore COVID-19 data using various queries. The project uses two tables, namely CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$, to retrieve the necessary data.

# Dataset Details
The project utilizes two datasets:

CovidDeaths$: Contains information about COVID-19 deaths, including country, date, and death counts.

CovidVaccinations$: Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations, including country, date, and vaccination counts.

# Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

Data Exploration: Use SQL queries to explore and analyze COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations.

Insights Generation: Extract meaningful insights from the data to understand the impact of the pandemic globally and the progress of vaccination campaigns.

Visualization: Store the processed data in a view for later visualization and analysis.

# SQL Queries
The SQL queries used in this project cover various aspects of COVID-19 data analysis, including:

1.Selecting data for exploration

2.Analyzing total cases and deaths

3.Comparing total cases to population

4.Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population

5.Breaking down the data by continent

6.Analyzing global numbers

# Usage
To replicate the analysis and explore the COVID-19 data using SQL:

1.Ensure that you have a compatible database management system (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

2.Create a database and import the provided CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$ tables.

3.Copy the SQL code from the SQLCode.sql file and execute it in your DBMS to run the queries.

4.Analyze the results and extract insights from the COVID-19 data.
