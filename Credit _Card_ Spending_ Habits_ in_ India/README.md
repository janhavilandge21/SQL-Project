# Credit Card Spending Habits in India
This project focuses on analyzing credit card spending habits in India. It involves querying a database to extract valuable insights related to cities, card types, expenses, and other transaction details.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing credit card transaction information, including city, card type, expense type, transaction amount, and transaction date. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of credit card spending patterns in India.

# Queries and Analysis
The project includes several SQL queries that perform different analyses on the dataset. Here is a summary of each task and its corresponding query:

Task 1: Print the top 5 cities with the highest spends and their percentage contribution to the total credit card spends.

Task 2: Print the highest spend month and the amount spent in that month for each card type.

Task 3: Print the transaction details for each card type when it reaches a cumulative total of 1000000 spends.

Task 4: Find the city that had the lowest percentage spend for the gold card type.

Task 5: Print three columns - city, highest_expense_type, and lowest_expense_type - showing the city and its corresponding highest and lowest expense types.

Task 6: Find the percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type.

Task 7: Determine the card and expense type combination that saw the highest month-over-month growth in Jan-2014.

Task 8: Identify the city with the highest total spend-to-transaction ratio during weekends.

Task 9: Find the city that took the least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city.

Please refer to the corresponding SQL queries for detailed implementations of each task.

# Visualization
The project does not include visualizations; it focuses primarily on extracting insights through SQL queries. However, the results of these queries can be further visualized using tools like Tableau or Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Usage
To replicate the analysis:

1.Download the dataset from the provided link or source the dataset from a database.

2.Import the dataset into your preferred database management system (DBMS).

3.Copy and execute the SQL queries for each task in your DBMS to retrieve the desired results.

4.Feel free to modify the queries or add more tasks to explore additional aspects of credit card spending habits in India.
